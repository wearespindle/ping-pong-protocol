# Devhouse Spindle Ping Pong Protocol
## House Rules
The Spindle Ping Pong Protocol (SP3) states certain basic house rules. The descriptions can be found below in this document. Make sure to follow the rules. If you aren’t sure what the rules are, ask anyone playing at the table. If someone is playing who can’t explain one of the rules, they are a Newbie and must get you a coffee or a beverage of your choice from the pantry when the game is over.

The SP3 states that this specific set of rules apply to any game of ping pong played at Devhouse Spindle, Het Kwadraat, Lübeckweg 2, Groningen, the Netherlands. Any other group is free to follow this set of rules, determined by the Spindle Ping Pong Club. For changes, refer to the section about pull requests.

### Times
The SP3 states the following times as acceptable times to play ping pong:
On working days from 12:15 until 13:15
On Friday after 16:00
Be considerate to others. Think before you play because the sound echoes.

### Equipment
The SP3 states that all equipment used to play the game should be handled with love and the utmost care. The table is not a couch or chair. If the table is dirty, make sure you clean it before you go back to work or home for the weekend.
Devhouse Spindle will provide enough balls and bats. If there are more players than bats on a given day, the bats can be supplemented with books from the library.

## Current Playing Rules
The SP3  states that the rounds are played in a “round table” fashion: the first person serves then moves around the table to the other side. The player on the other side does the same: return the ball and move to the other side of the table. The next player in line on each side of the table proceeds in a similar manner.

The round stops as soon as one of the players makes a mistake (or another player “helps” him or her make said mistake - see “dick move” below). The player who made the mistake is then out. Another round is started as soon as another player serves and starts running around the table.

Once all but two players are left, the game enters the final stage: the finale. Eh. The finale is a match between the two players where the winner is the first to score 2 points. Once the winner has been decided, a new game can be started with all the other players who lost in the previous one. Also, the winner of a game can (and should) decide on a modifier.

### Special moves
The SP3 states that any player, at any time, is allowed to make a move to alter the flow of the game and/or disturb other players. Be aware that certain types of moves can be contested.

#### Hitting an object on the table
Any object placed by players or already present on the table before the game starts are included in the play. In the event a ball in play hits an object on the table, the player receiving that shot can then let the ball bounce on his or her side of the table for as many times as he or she wants. The player then sends it back according to the rules or modifier decided for the current round (see “modifiers list” below).

#### Hinder
This applies to any kind of moves that physically prevents a player from hitting the ball - namely putting yourself, your bat, or any non-ethereal or immaterial object between another player’s bat and the ball he or she aims to hit - leading to this player making a mistake and being taken out of the game.

The hindered player may call out the move that hindered him or her saying “Hinder!”. If the move is agreed by the rest of the players as a hindrance, the player who suffered it may stay in the game and the game goes on.

#### Ghosting
Any player who has been taken out of the game may try to blend with the active players in an attempt to ghost a fellow player. By being part of the active players, the ghosting player can fake playing a ball and purposely missing it, thus causing the player after him to be out since the ball was meant to be played by him or her. A player who is out of the game may try to ghost active players as many times as he or she wishes, as long as the active players don’t notice him or her.

Any player may ask any fellow player if he or she is still an active player by asking “Are you still in?”. The player being asked must respond swiftly and truthfully.

#### Dick moves
A dick move can be any kind of action taken by a fellow player in or out of the game to take another player out, namely, hitting the ball away from the table, moving the table itself (do exercise caution and mind your surroundings), or anything that is not regarded as a hinder move. A player can call out a dick move, however, if said move causes that player to be out he or she will not be able to reintegrate into active play and just has to suck it up.

#### The wow! exception
In the case of a play of exceptional quality (or randomness) leading to the player becoming out of the game (ball is foul, doesn’t reach the table, etc.), the player may stay in the game if all the other active players are wowed by the performance: namely, other players go “Wow” or similar exclamation.

It is quite a rare occurrence and is generally proposed by the other players who witness an amazing play or stroke of luck.

#### Not accepting a lone opponent’s serve
The SP3  states that if a player serves while having no other player on his or her side of the table, the player receiving the serve may either:
Play the serve in any way that keeps the ball alive while rushing to the other side of the table to receive it and play it again. All other players must then do the same until someone commits a foul and another player serves again.
Refuse the serve by saying “Not accepted!” and serving him- or herself instead.

A lone player is not able to not accept a serve if the other side has 2 players or more. However, if 1 or more ghost players are standing next to a lone player on one side of the table they can accept the serve. If the receiving side of the table is aware that they are in fact ghost players, the receiving side may not accept a serve. In the event that the receiving side isn’t aware of the ghost players being ghosts, then the play goes on and the ghosts can succeed in taking the receiving player out.

#### Confusion
If a player fails to correctly return the ball because they do not understand the modifier or are confused by the rules that are applied, they may claim "Confusion". The player claiming "Confusion" may then stay in the game.

Claiming "Confusion" is regarded as a lame, boring, uncool thing to do, similar to cheating in video games.

### Modifier
The SP3 states that if someone wins a finale, they may choose a modifier as a rule for the next game. It may concern any aspect of the game, how the players should play or interact with each other or the game environment.

Modifiers may also be combined or used simultaneously.

Modifier list

|Modifier name | Description|
| --- | --- |
|Classic | Triple optional + snipe.|
|Normal | A good ol' game of ping pong using Spindle specs.|
|Always serve |All players must play the ball as if hitting a serve: the ball has to bounce on each side of the net each time.|
|Hand in/on ... | All players keep a hand on/in the designed spot during the entirety of the game or will be out if they don't. Most used variant is "Hand in the sack", meaning all those wearing pants with pockets put their 'wrong hand' into their pocket. Those without pockets keep their hand as if doing so.|
|Tennis | The ball needs to be played after it bounces x time(s) on the ground. The ball can bounce on the receiving player's side of the table as many times as necessary to fall off the table and hit the ground. Serve can be included or played like a normal one. Returns may be played as a normal or always serve play.|
|Triple optional | Players have to play either a normal, always serve, or tennis hit to return the ball. The choice is their own except if mentioned otherwise at the beginning of the game.|
|Triple choptional | Same as the Triple optional modifier except the always serve and tennis plays must be played while adding a spin to the ball. For normal returns, spins are forbidden.|
|T-rex | Players tuck their playing arm either in their sleeve or close to their body to mimic a T-rex's small arms and must play all hits like so.|
|Chicken wings | Players must hold the bat in the inside of their elbow to play the ball to mimic a chicken's wing.|
|Below the table | All balls must be played under the level of the table. The ball can bounce on the receiving player's side of the table as many times as necessary to fall off the table and hit the ground. Serve can be included or played like a normal one. Returns may be played as a normal or always serve play.|
|Ground smash | Similar to the Tennis modifier the ball needs to first bounce off the table, hit the ground x time(s). Then the player hits the ball into the ground in order to send it back to the other side of the table. The ball can bounce on the receiving player's side of the table as many times as necessary to fall off the table and hit the ground. Serve can be included or played like a normal one. Returns may be played as a normal or always serve play.|
|Snipe | Players can try and hit the ball towards another player to hit them and take them out of the game. This modifier is usually added as an optional modifier on top of another one.|
|Serve decides the play area | When the serve is played, the 2 rectangles on each side of the net the ball bounces on are the ones the following player must play on as well.|
|Phone bat | Play the game using your phone as a bat.|
|Wrong hand | Play the game using your non-dominant hand.|
|Double trouble | Play the game with the bat in both hands. One hand should be on the handle, the other on the opposite side of the bat.|
|Above... | Play the game hitting the ball above a point defined by the modifier's creator.|
|Lopje | When receiving the ball, you're allowed to hit it an extra time to get it higher in the air; perfect for smash.|
|Fibonacci | To be combined with, for example, Tennis or Always serve. The number of bounces relates to the Fibonacci sequence (i.e. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...). The sequence resets with every serve, unless specified otherwise.|
|Smash on demand | Whenever another active players calls "Smash" the next player receiving the ball has to smash the ball. Usually limited to one call per player per round.|
|"It's complicated" | Whenever a player is knocked out, he or she can say "I love you, (wo)man" to another player who's already out, who's then reintegrated into the game. Or "I hate you, (wo)man!" to a player who's still in who's then also knocked out.|
|Say "..." | Every time the ball passes the net, the player receiving the ball must say a certain thing (e.g. an animal species, a power of 2, a French word). If the receiving player fails to do so before hitting the ball back, that player is out.|
|Ball is lava| If a player touches the ball, they are out.|
|Ball is lightning| Similar to Ball is lava, but the effect is canceled if the player does not touch the ground while touching the ball.|

### Code of Conduct
The SP3 states that every player should conduct themselves in a friendly way. Regular players, as well as guests, should conduct themselves in a positive way at all times. Next to that are the following guidelines:
You want to win above everything, but be nice about it!
Mixing Friday afternoon drinks with a game of ping-pong is always welcome!
Favoritism is allowed as well as promoted in order to enhance the atmosphere of the game.
Inviting guests deserves a reward and all guests, as well as the player who brought them, will be met with enthusiasm.

### Pull Requests
The SP3 states that If you wish to change or add to these rules, submit a pull request to Github (https://github.com/wearespindle/ping-pong-protocol) with your requested change or addition.
